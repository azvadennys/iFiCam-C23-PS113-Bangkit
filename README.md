## Transfer Learning InceptionV3
<p align="left">
 InceptionV3 is a deep learning model used for image classification, including the classification of ten types of fish. It is pre-trained on a large dataset and can extract relevant features from fish images. The model's architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. It is trained using labeled fish images, and can classify new images by assigning probabilities to each fish species. InceptionV3 is effective for accurately identifying fish species based on visual characteristics.

## Dataset
<p align="left">
We obtained the dataset by photographing fish from the market, making it our original data. We augmented the dataset using Roboflow to enhance its diversity. The dataset was then split into a training set and a test set. The training set was used to train the InceptionV3 model, while the test set was used to evaluate its performance.
